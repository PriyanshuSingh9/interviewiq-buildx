## 🚀 Overview

**InterviewIQ** is an agentic AI-powered mock interview platform designed to bridge the gap between candidate preparation and real-world interviewer expectations. Unlike static Q&A tools, InterviewIQ features an autonomous AI agent that thinks, adapts, and probes deeper based on your unique profile and real-time responses.

Build your confidence by mastering **Behavioral**, **Technical**, and **System Design** rounds with an AI that interviews just like a real Engineering Manager.

## 🎯 The Challenge: Hackathon Problem Statement
### The Solution
We built an agentic platform that autonomously conducts end-to-end mock interviews tailored to a candidate's target role, experience level, and resume. Our AI agent goes beyond scripts; it detects weak answers, probes deeper into technical trade-offs, and provides structured, actionable feedback.

## 🧠 The Agentic Workflow

InterviewIQ demonstrates sophisticated agentic behavior across the entire interview lifecycle:

- **Pre-Interview (Ingestion)**: Autonomously parses resumes and GitHub repositories to extract architectural skeletons and skill sets, generating a 100% personalized interview plan.
- **During Interview (Adaptive Logic)**: The agent doesn't just ask questions — it listens and adapts. It can interrupt, ask follow-up questions on technical deep-dives, and transition naturally between rounds.
- **Post-Interview (Intelligent Synthesis)**: Delivers a comprehensive executive report featuring radar charts, communication analysis, knowledge depth scoring, and a personalized roadmap for improvement.
