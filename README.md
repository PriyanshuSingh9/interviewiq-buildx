## Overview

**InterviewIQ** is an agentic AI-powered mock interview platform designed to bridge the gap between candidate preparation and real-world interviewer expectations. Unlike static Q&A tools, InterviewIQ features an autonomous AI agent that thinks, adapts, and probes deeper — based on your unique profile and real-time responses. **It grows with you, becoming more nuanced and contextually aware as you navigate the interview process.**

Build confidence by mastering **Behavioral**, **Technical**, **System Design**, and **Coding** rounds with an AI that interviews just like a real Engineering Manager.

## The Problem

Job seekers — especially fresh graduates and career switchers — lack access to realistic, personalized interview practice. Existing solutions are either static (pre-recorded questions) or expensive (human coaches), leaving candidates underprepared for the dynamic, unpredictable nature of real interviews.

**InterviewIQ** solves this by autonomously conducting end-to-end mock interviews tailored to a candidate's target role, experience level, resume, and actual GitHub code. The AI goes beyond scripts: it detects weak answers, probes into technical trade-offs, runs real-time coding assessments, and delivers a structured post-interview analytics report.

## Agentic Workflow

InterviewIQ demonstrates sophisticated agentic behavior across the entire interview lifecycle:

**Pre-Interview (Ingestion):** Autonomously parses resumes and GitHub repositories to extract architectural patterns and skill sets, generating a fully personalized interview plan.

**During Interview (Adaptive Voice):** Uses the Gemini Multimodal Live API to enable low-latency, natural voice interactions. The agent listens and adapts — asking follow-up questions and drilling into technical trade-offs in real time.

**Coding Assessment:** A seamless split-pane code editor executes real code via the Piston API, with the agent grading quality, edge case handling, and correctness.

**Post-Interview (Intelligent Synthesis):** A centralized Reports Hub delivers deep analytics, fit scores, and actionable feedback calibrated to the target engineering level.

## Features

### 1. Command Center (Dashboard)

Upload your resume and GitHub profile, then watch the agent generate a custom interview plan. It extracts your projects, evaluates your baseline fit, and creates reusable interview presets.

### 2. Live Agentic Voice Interview

Experience a seamless WebRTC connection to the Gemini Multimodal Live API. The agent reviews your specific architectural choices, probes for trade-offs, and updates a real-time transcript as you speak.

### 3. Integrated Coding Round

Solve role-specific algorithmic and debugging challenges in a VS Code-quality Monaco Editor. Code is executed in a secure sandbox and the AI agent evaluates your solution in real time, providing actionable feedback and a final score.
